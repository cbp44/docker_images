# Docker Images

This is a collection of useful Docker images I've created for use in various projects.

I have published all of the images to Docker Hub for easy usage as base images or as a way to copy executables / code from them into a multi-stage build `Dockerfile`.

## Dockerize
Docker images using `ubuntu` as base with [dockerize](https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize) program pre-installed.

Documentation [here](dockerize/README.md)
