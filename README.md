# docker_images

This is a collection of useful Docker images I've created for use in various projects.

I have published all of the images here to Docker Hub for easy usage as base images or as a way to copy executables / code from them in multi-stage build Dockerfiles.

## The Images

### dockerize

Docker image using `ubuntu` image as base with [dockerize](https://github.com/jwilder/dockerize) program pre-installed at `/usr/local/bin/dockerize`.

See [usage examples](https://github.com/cbp44/docker_images/dockerize/USAGE.md).
